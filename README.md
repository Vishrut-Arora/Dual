- The project is regarding development of a multiplayer game wherein you use a combination of Arduino and Android/Processing capabilities for enabling a fun, new gaming experience. Our game is multiplayer with two shooters shooting at each other with bullets controlled by touch sensors . The shooters are controlled by two ultrasonic sensors
respectively . The ultrasonic sensors are attached adjacent to each other on the box where two joysticks are use for their movement . For the bullets the touch
sensors would be placed in the opposite hand. With the help of ultrasonic sensors the shooters are moving up and down and with the help of touch sensors the bullets are moving towards the opposite shooter . There is an enemy also in the middle for bonus points hence making it single player.
